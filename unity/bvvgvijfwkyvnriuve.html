We hear the footsteps of the people<br>
The coins strike the ground above our lair<br>
Still we know that we must stay here<br>
Until our Lord arises from the deep<br><br>

The merchants wish for peace<br>
The soldiers wish for war<br>
We can hear their heart's desires<br>
Destiny will judge them all<br><br>

Our wish is far more ancient<br>
And soon it shall be fulfilled<br>
The sounds of their wishes will be drowned out<br>
By the deafening sound of silence.<br>
